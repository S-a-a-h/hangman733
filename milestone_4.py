Hangman Game

This script allows the user to play the hangman game directly from their CLI.
All files associated to this game are coded in Python and stored as (.py). 
This script requires that 'random' be installed with the Python environment which the code is stored in. 

This file can be imported as a class containing the following methods:
    * _check_guess - a protected method which converts the guessed letter to lowercase, 
        checks if the the guess is in the word and checks how many lives are remaining after the guess.
    * _update_word_guessed - a protected method which updates the word with the guess, if correct, or 
        reduces the number of lives left by 1 if incorrect.
    * _lives_left - a protected method which prints remaining number of lives only if the guess is 
        incorrect. 
    * ask_for_input - a public method which asks the user for a single, alphabetical letter as a guess
        and validates it before checking it via _check_guess method and adding the guess to a list of
        previous guesses so as to avoid repitition in the game.
