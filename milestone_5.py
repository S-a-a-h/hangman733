Hangman Game

This script allows the user to play the hangman game directly from their CLI.
All files associated with this game are coded in Python and stored as (.py) files. 
This script requires that 'random' be installed in the Python environment which the code is stored in. 

This file can be imported as a class containing the following methods:
    * _check_guess - a protected method which converts the guessed letter to lowercase, 
        checks if the the guess is in the word and checks how many lives are remaining after the guess.
    * _update_word_guessed - a protected method which updates the word with the guess, if correct, or 
        reduces the number of lives left by 1 if incorrect.
    * _lives_left - a protected method which prints remaining number of lives only if the guess is 
        incorrect. 
    * ask_for_input - a public method which asks the user for a single, alphabetical letter as a guess
        and validates it before checking it via _check_guess method and adding the guess to a list of
        previous guesses so as to avoid repitition in the game. 
    * _play_game - a protected method which ensures that if the number of lives is 0, the game is lost. 
        If not, this method checks that the number of remaining letters is more than 0 in order 
        for the game to continue until a win or loss.

import random 


word_list = ['orange', 'kiwi', 'durian', 'rambutan', 'lime']

list_of_guesses = []
'''
    * word_list - sets the word list from which the computer will randomly choose a word - this can 
        be changed by the user if necessary, and all other code will run according to the user-modified 
        list.
    * word - instructs computer to randomly select a word from the word_list using installed package: 
    'random'.
    * list_of_guesses - creates an empty list which will be appended to as the game is initiated and played.
